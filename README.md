# AdProject-PythonFlaskServer

This is the Python Flask server our team has deployed for our Final AD project (part 1 out of 3).

Needs to be run together with the Springboot AD Project component and Android AD Project component to work.

The Flask server here pretty much hosts a simple Machine Learning model that runs the inputs received from the Springboot web application and generates an outcome after
running through the Logistic regression classification model in an attempt to identify the mental health state of the user.
